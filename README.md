# Rating Modal

This project is an interactive rating modal developed using React.js and TypeScript, with star animations managed through React DOM and Lucide React icons. The goal is to create a smooth, engaging user experience for feedback systems, where users can rate from 1 to 5 stars. Each star is animated to visually represent the user’s rating as they hover or click on it.

## Features

- Interactive Rating System: Users can rate from 1 to 5 stars by hovering and clicking.
- Smooth Animations: Star animations are triggered on hover and selection.
- Customizable Icons: Star icons are rendered using Lucide React for a modern and scalable design.
- TypeScript-Driven Logic: Strong typing with TypeScript ensures better code quality and easier debugging.
- Responsive: The modal design is responsive, adapting to various screen sizes.

## Tech Stack
- React.js: For building the component structure and user interface.
- TypeScript: To enhance the code with static typing and improved tooling.
- React DOM: For efficient rendering and manipulation of the DOM.
- Material-UI: For pre-built components and styles to enhance the user interface.
- Lucide React: For elegant and customizable icons in the modal.
